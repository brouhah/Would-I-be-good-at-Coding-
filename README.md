# Would I be good at Coding?

In this repository you'll find at home coding to determine if coding is for me!

I've left everything categorized into sub-branches that are seperate from the master branch to keep the master branch clean, simple, and efficient. The "Practice" branch is exactly what it sounds like, these are a combination of tutorials, self-challenges, and examples of code that I've written to understand how to use some of the language in python further. You'll also find my fizzbuzz programs in this branch!
